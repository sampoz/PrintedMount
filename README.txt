This is a 3d-printed camera mount for sky photography. The project is not ready, but the demonstration of the WIP is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MEBemAZFiw&feature=youtu.be 

3d-models are not printable without aftertouches, mostly because of problems with blender, there are additional geometry inside the objects. As soon as I have time, I will remedy this and remake the models.

If you are interested about building this, you can ask me about the designs, I can me found at IRCnet with nick sampoz
